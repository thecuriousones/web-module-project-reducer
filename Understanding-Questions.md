# Understanding Questions:
1. What are the steps of execution from the pressing of the 1 button to the rendering of our updated value? List what part of the code excutes for each step.
* The user presses the 1 button.
* The onClick handler invokes dispatch, which calls addOne.
* The reducer uses addOne as a case where it will copy the current state and add 1 to it, returning the current state + 1.
* TotalDisplay shows the total plus 1.
